## Briefing: Download the file and find a way to get the flag.

# My Solution
Opening the file in a text editor, the whole thing only consists of emojis.

There does seem to be a regularity to the emojis, and there are only 26 unique ones. I chose to paste all the emojis into a document, and used the find and replace function to replace each emoji with a letter in the English alphabet (the doc with the emojis turned into text is called "cm02 decoded.txt"). Following that, I used a [substitution solver](https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver) to find the flag.
